#### 1.5.2 Security & Data Protection (16 hours) [COMPLETED]

**Objective:** Implement industry-standard security practices for data protection

**Security Requirements:**
1. **Transport Security:**
   - HTTPS/TLS for all connections (Let's Encrypt SSL on Nginx)
   - Supabase connections over TLS
   - Telegram Bot API uses HTTPS

2. **Data Protection:**
   - Supabase Auth password hashing (bcrypt automatically)
   - RLS policies enforce data isolation by role
   - Environment variables for all secrets (no hardcoded credentials)
   - Sensitive data fields in Supabase (client emails, phone numbers, feedback comments)

3. **API Security:**
   - Telegram webhook signature validation
   - Supabase JWT token validation (httpOnly cookies)
   - Rate limiting on bot endpoints (prevent abuse)
   - Input validation with Zod schemas

4. **Secrets Management:**
   - Environment variables for:
     - `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
     - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
     - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - `REDIS_URL`
   - Never commit secrets to git (.env in .gitignore)
   - Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD

**Optional Encryption (if required later):**
```typescript
// Encrypt sensitive data at application level (optional)
import crypto from 'crypto';

const ENCRYPTION_KEY = process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY; // 32-byte key
const algorithm = 'aes-256-gcm';

function encrypt(text: string): string {
  const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(algorithm, ENCRYPTION_KEY, iv);
  let encrypted = cipher.update(text, 'utf8', 'hex');
  encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
  const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();
  return `${iv.toString('hex')}:${authTag.toString('hex')}:${encrypted}`;
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All connections use HTTPS/TLS
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in code (all in environment variables)
- ✅ Telegram webhook signature validation working
- ✅ Supabase RLS policies enforced
- ✅ Password authentication secure (Supabase Auth bcrypt)

### Database Design Principles
- **Normalization:** 3NF minimum
- **Indexes:** On all foreign keys and frequently queried columns

- **Soft deletes:** Use `deleted_at` instead of hard deletes
- **Audit trail:** Track who created/updated each record

### API Design Principles
- **RESTful** or **tRPC** (type-safe preferred)
- **Pagination:** Limit 100 items per page max

- **Sorting:** Support ASC/DESC on key columns
- **Error responses:** Consistent format (status code, message, details)

### Bot UX Principles
- **Fast responses:** <2s for all commands
- **Clear feedback:** Always acknowledge user action
